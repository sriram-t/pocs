# Designing Idempotent API Endpoints for Payments at Stripe

## 🎯 Overview
This document summarizes the key concepts and design principles explained in the video  
**“Designing Idempotent API Endpoints for Payments at Stripe.”**

The talk focuses on how Stripe ensures **safe retries** and **exactly-once payment processing** in distributed systems through **idempotent API design**.

---

## 🧠 What Is Idempotency?

**Idempotency** means that performing the same operation multiple times results in the **same outcome** as performing it once.

In payment systems, this is essential because:
- Network failures or timeouts can leave the client **unsure** if a payment succeeded.
- Retrying the same request could **charge the customer twice**.
- Idempotent APIs guarantee that **only one payment** is ever created, even if the same request is sent multiple times.

---

## ⚙️ How Stripe Implements Idempotency

### 1. Idempotency Key
Every request that may cause a side effect (like charging a customer) must include a unique **Idempotency-Key** — typically a UUID generated by the client.

**Example:**
```http
POST /v1/charges
Idempotency-Key: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

### 2. Server Logic
When Stripe receives a request:
1. It checks if the **Idempotency-Key** has been seen before.
2. If **new**, the server processes the request (e.g., create payment) and stores the result.
3. If **existing**, it **returns the previously stored result** — without reprocessing the payment.

This guarantees that multiple identical requests lead to **a single charge**.

### 3. Data Storage
Stripe maintains a temporary store mapping:
```
Idempotency-Key → Response Body + HTTP Status
```
The stored response is reused for subsequent duplicate requests.

### 4. TTL (Time to Live)
Idempotency keys are not stored forever — typically they expire after **24 hours**.
Once expired, the same key can be reused safely.

### 5. Parameter Consistency
If a client reuses an idempotency key but **changes the request parameters**, the server rejects it with a **409 Conflict** or similar error.

This prevents accidental reuse of a key for different requests.

## 🧩 Client Retry Strategy

### ✅ Safe Retries
Clients can safely retry when:
- Network timeouts occur.
- The connection breaks.
- The client does not receive a response.

Since the server treats duplicate requests as the same, retries don’t create extra payments.

### ⏱ Backoff and Jitter
To avoid overwhelming servers during outages:
- Use **exponential backoff** — increase delay between retries.
- Add **random jitter** — introduce randomness to prevent all clients retrying simultaneously (avoiding the *thundering herd* problem).

---

## ✅ Benefits of Idempotent APIs

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Reliability** | Prevents duplicate payments, even during retries or failures. |
| **Simplicity** | Clients don’t need complex retry logic — safe to resend until success. |
| **Consistency** | Guarantees predictable results for identical requests. |
| **Resilience** | Handles partial network failures gracefully. |
| **Auditability** | Provides consistent responses for the same operation, improving traceability. |

---

## ⚠️ Design Considerations

| Concern | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Storage Overhead** | The system must persist idempotency keys and results temporarily. |
| **Concurrency Control** | Two simultaneous requests with the same key must be handled atomically to avoid race conditions. |
| **Conflict Detection** | Detect when identical keys are used with different payloads. |
| **TTL Balance** | Too short → retries might fail; too long → wastes storage. |

## 🧱 Example Request Flow

```plaintext
Client                        Stripe Server
  │ POST /charge (key=A)
  │────────────────────────────▶│
  │◀────────────────────────────│ Process payment and store (A → Result)
  │ Timeout — retry
  │ POST /charge (key=A)
  │────────────────────────────▶│
  │◀────────────────────────────│ Return stored Result (no reprocessing)
```

This flow ensures only one payment occurs even with multiple identical requests.

---

## 💻 Example Pseudocode

### Client Side (Node.js-style)
```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

async function createPayment(amount) {
  const idempotencyKey = uuidv4();
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      "https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges",
      { amount, currency: "usd" },
      { headers: { "Idempotency-Key": idempotencyKey } }
    );
    return response.data;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Retry safe due to idempotency:", err.message);
  }
}
```

### Server Side (Conceptual)
```python
def handle_payment(request):
    key = request.headers.get("Idempotency-Key")
    if key in cache:
        return cache[key]  # Return previous result

    result = process_payment(request.body)
    cache[key] = result  # Store for next time
    return result
```

## 🧩 Implementation Tips
- Use **UUIDv4** for globally unique idempotency keys.
- Store key–response pairs in a **low-latency datastore** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
- Include **TTL** expiration to manage memory efficiently.
- Detect and reject conflicting payloads using the same key.
- Implement atomic locking or transaction control to avoid concurrent duplication.

---

## 🏁 Key Takeaways
- Always use **idempotency keys** for operations that must only happen once (e.g., payments, account creation).
- The **server** guarantees that side effects occur only once.
- The **client** can safely retry until success without worrying about duplication.
- Combine **key-based deduplication**, **response caching**, and **backoff retries** for reliable API design.
