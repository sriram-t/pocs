# Three-Tier Architecture

## Overview

The **Three-Tier Architecture** is a widely adopted software design pattern that separates an application into three distinct layers â€” **Presentation**, **Application**, and **Data**.  
This separation improves **scalability**, **maintainability**, **security**, and **operational efficiency** by clearly defining responsibilities across tiers.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- **Purpose:** Handles user interaction and displays information to the end user.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - User Interface (UI) and user experience (UX)
    - Sending user requests to the backend
    - Rendering data from APIs
- **Typical Technologies:** React, Angular, Vue.js, HTML/CSS
- **Example:** A web dashboard where users create or view deals.

---

### 2. Application Layer (Service Layer)
- **Purpose:** Acts as the **middle layer** that processes requests, applies business logic, and communicates between the frontend and data layer.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Enforcing business rules and validation
    - Managing workflows and transactions
    - Integrating with APIs and external systems
- **Typical Technologies:** Node.js, Java Spring Boot, Python Flask/FastAPI, .NET Core
- **Example:** A backend service that calculates deal P&L and orchestrates data retrieval.

### 3. Data Layer
- **Purpose:** Responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing application data.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Database management and data persistence
    - Query optimization and data security
    - Serving structured and analytical data
- **Typical Technologies:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Redshift, MongoDB, DynamoDB
- **Example:** Redshift or RDS storing deal information, forecasts, and user configurations.
